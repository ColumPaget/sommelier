.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Sommelier is an installer for downloadable applications that can be run under a number of emulators. The main focus is windows applications that can be run under the \(aqwine\(aq emulator, but currently it also supports ms-dos applications that can be run under \(aqdosbox\(aq; adventure games that can be run under the\(aqscummvm\(aq emulator; zx-spectrum apps that can be run under the \(aqfuse\(aq emulator; downloads from gog.com that can be run either under wine, dosbox, or natively on linux; and doom wads that can be run under \(aqchocolate-doom\(aq or \(aqcrispy-doom\(aq. 
.P
Installed applications are stored under a \(aq.sommelier\(aq directory in the user\(aqs home directory, each in a subdirectory of their own (what\(aqs known as a \(aqwine bottle\(aq for wine apps). Also in this directory are stored \(aq.apps\(aq configuration files that describe the list of installable apps.

.SH PLATFORMS

.P
The following platforms are supported for use in the 
.na
\-platform
.ad

 16-bit windows apps that run under wine
.TP

.SH PROXY URLS

.P
The 
.na
\-proxy
.ad
option is used with the \(aqdownload\(aq or \(aqinstall\(aq commands and accepts proxy urls of the form:

.nf

     <protocol>:<user>:<password><host>:<protocol>. 
.fi
.ad b

.P
\(aqprotocol\(aq can be \(aqsocks4\(aq, \(aqsocks5\(aq \(aqhttps\(aq or \(aqsshtunnel\(aq. For \(aqsshtunnel\(aq the names defined in the \*(ti/.ssh/config file can be used, so that  most of the information can be ommited.
.P
examples:

.nf

   https:bill:secret@proxy.com
   socks4:proxy.com:1080
   socks5:bill:secret@proxy.com:1080
   sshtunnel:bill:secret@ssh_host.com
   sshtunnel:sshproxy
.fi

.SH SETTINGS

.P
There are a number of settings that can be lastingly configured with the \(aqset\(aq command or using the 
.na
\-set
.ad
option when installing an application. Currently these settings only relate to programs run under wine, or doom wads run under chocolate-doom or crispy-doom.

.TP
.B fullscreen=y/n
 run program at fullscreen, or else within a virtual desktop
.TP
.B smoothfonts=y/n
 wine only: use font anti-aliasing
.TP
.B sound=y/n/sfx
 DOOM only: sound on/off, or only effects (no music)
.TP
.B grab=y/n
 DOOM only: grab mouse, or not

.P
For both DOOM and Wine you can set the size of the window using the vdesk setting, in the style 
.na
vdesk=600x300
.ad
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.P
Sommelier looks for the variables 
.na
SOMMELIER_CA_BUNDLE
.ad
, 
.na
CURL_CA_BUNDLE
.ad
and 
.na
SSL_VERIFY_FILE
.ad
, in that order, to discover the path of the Certificate Bundle for certificate verification.
If 
.na
SOMMELIER_INSTALLER_CACHE
.ad
is set, sommelier will download installer and .zip files to the specified directory, and leave them there for future use with the 
.na
\-url
.ad
option.
